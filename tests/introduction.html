    <h1>Functional Tests for the Neurospaces Model Container</h1>

    Below you find all the test specifications for the Neurospaces
    Model Container, the input to the test, the expected output for
    the test, and the command to start the application.

    <p>

      These tests should give a broad idea of what the Neurospaces
      Model Container does.  The level of testing is functional,
      ie. user experienced functionality (ie. no low-level unit
      tests).
