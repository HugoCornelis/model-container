Neurospaces design goals

Neurospaces is a data container for large and complex neuronal models.
It is used as an abstraction layer on top of a simulator and deals
with end-user concepts instead of mathematical equations.  This allows
to optimize the simulator separately from the modeling package.

The optimization of a neuronal simulator consists of ultimate accuracy
and performance.  Transforming complex biological parameters into
precomputed tables and optimizing for a high CPU cache hit ratio are
the most important features for a good simulator, and gives the
simulator a performance boost of about a factor four.

Neurospaces on the other hand, abstracts away all the mathematical and
computational details of the simulator.  Optimized to store large
models in little memory -- it stores neuronal models in a fraction of
the memory that would be used by conventional simulators -- it allows
for automatic partitioning of the model such that simulations can be
run in parallel.  From the modeler's side, Neurospaces will be able to
import and export NeuroML files, facilitating exchange of models and
ideas, and fostering computational neuroscience.
