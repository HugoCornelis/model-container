* morphology2ndf
Has a hardcoded snippet from Data::Utilities::merge().
Replace this with calls to the Data::Utilities module.

* private model section
Is a mess since children inside children were introduced.  Needs
cleanup.

* ParContainerDelete()
** Problem
Is sometimes called in reduce methods with parameter arguments not in
the container.  This gives funny results such as moving parameters
from one symbol to another etc.  Additional logic is required that
makes sure that the correct parameter container is used.
** reducing.t
Has a test for the above, but it is currently disabled (because it
does not work).  This test should be enabled after the bugfix.

* Replace
ParameterLookup() with ParContainerLookup().

* remove tokens
gate_kinetic_a
gate_kinetic_b

* groups can traverse segments.
but they are not segmenters.  See -r
4bfaed89e383c98bee3b98e4bff30dd9d107ee35.
** or move segmenter capabilities to biocomponents and merge them.
** or implement traverse_segments and count_segments for groups.
We need better delegation mechanisms.

* solve shift reduce conflicts
** step 1 (complete)
Likely some of them can be solved by introducing a single
ParameterValue non-terminal that reduces from Identifier and
TOKEN_STRING and merges the two reduction branches of the grammar.
** step 2
Likely they will then disappear if we replace pidins with
pcIdentifiers everywhere.

* check the tools directory of G2
contains a couple of useful model operations.

* neurospaces/config.h
DELETE_OPERATION is checked for hierarchy/symbols by reading
neurospaces/config.h and using pattern matching.  Unfortunately, the
file path of neurospaces/config.h is not known by hierarchy/symbols,
the file is read as if it is in the current directory with path name
neurospaces/config.h.  This does not work when hierarchy/symbols is
loaded by other modules, such as the gshell.

* reduce flag
For elements that have been reduced.  Applies to the whole subtree.

* Add an ANNOTATION element
** 3D coordinates for network annotation and visualization
** CONTENT parameter that points to the free style content of the annotation

* Reenable the support for readline

* PROTOTYPE_IDENTIFIER parameter
In prototyping.t: 'This test needs to be enhanced with setting
parameters of symbols and using parameter caches.  Doing so should
change the value of the PROTOTYPE_IDENTIFIER automatically',

* split shorthand for bindables and bindings combinations.
See channels/nmda.ndf

* complete tests for subpopulations

* instrumentor and the gshell
#t subs from the model-container instrumentor, should be put in a
#t separate package and installed by the model-container or so.
|   1. Copied over a couple of subs of the instrumentor of the
|      model-container, such that run-time symbol information is available
|      in a consistent fashion.

* movable elements
grep //t movable_parameter_name().

* implement tests for parameter that cannot be resolved
Bugs in the source can easily be found by browsing on
SegmenterIsSpherical().
** segment volume tests
** channel scaling tests
** pool scaling tests
Seems that SegmenterIsSpherical() should just be moved to
SegmentIsSpherical() ?

* swig and autotools
http://www.geocities.com/foetsch/python/swig_linux.htm

* Implement state_init for default case.

* delete operation
The delete operation calls SymbolRecalcAllSerials().
SymbolRecalcAllSerials() should set a flag that the symbol serial has
been affected (including descendants).  SegmenterLinearize() (oa) can
pick up this flag, and decide to recalculate indices.  Use
FLAGS_HSLE_AFFECTED or so.

* swc files
** p20 of dendritica is an example of multiple compartments in the soma
adapt morphology2ndf accordingly, group all these compartments in a
segment group with name soma.
** when converting swc files, soma case
The dimensions of the soma are not correctly converted, no clue how
that is supposed to be done.

* swigi_coordinates_2_array()
Make TRAVERSAL_INFO_NAMES optional, depending on options given by the
caller.

* perl glue & morphology2ndf
add a way to include the morphology2ndf configuration directly from
the perl interface.  Then this propagates automatically to the SSP
config.

* replace the SPHERICAL option for segments
with a regular flag like parameter, then activate the alternate hh
models that are supposedly the same as the one used now.

* remove all parameter caching
Using SymbolSetParameter{Context,Double,String}() because it
introduces inconsistencies at this moment.
** SymbolSetParameter.*() use
allocates if necessary the parameter, caches it and returns it.  So we
must allocate it in order to return it, so if it does not get cached,
we have a memory leak.

* tests specifications
** Should have two levels for disabled:
*** one says the test cannot work for a fundamental reason
*** the other says the test cannot work in this configuration
but it should work in different configuration (eg. routing table not
good).
** tests_2_html uses this information correctly.

* tests_2_html
produces tables that always have <pre> entries, even for 'comment',
'disabled', etc.

* SymbolSerialRecalcPostProcessor():
** needs TstrGetActualParentType() implementation.
uses iType from child to do alien typing on the parent symbol.
This is a clear and serious bug.

* morphology2ndf
See if Tree::Parser can be used to read neurolucida files.

* list of global variables
** pnscGlobal
** pifRootImport
** pneuroGlobal

* fibers
allow to map (climbing) fibers from the neuromorpho database using the
swc tag value, if that makes sense.

* Add support for Rall's geometric ratio
GR = \sum[d]{ \frac{ r ^ \frac{3}{2}_d }{ r ^ \frac{3}{2}_p }

* Add support for AP propagation efficacy

* instrumentor
Use regexes to scan selected sources for function definitions.  Use a
table that defines the instrumentation relationships.  Combine both to
automate the generation of the Symbol.*() functions further than now.

* consolidate parameter settings:
ParameterNewFromPidinQueue() calls ParameterSetString(), should not be
calling this low-level function.  More support for PidinQueues needed.

* test runner
Add a mechanism to obtain information from stdout and incorporate it
into the error report.  Good test candidates are the timings of the
coordinate caches and connection caches related queries.

* test runner
Should report the package name and version number, always.  And of
some important packages (swig), and hardware profile.

* implement tests for ParameterResolveToPidinStack()
** for cases that work
See in12_1.ndf and related.
** for cases that do not work
in errors.t.

* add a test that maps serial to context and back to serial
and check if these are the same.

* rename contour_point to em_contour_point

* tests_2_html
Parse the arguments passed to the command, and hand them to
source_2_html.

* The config.log file must be installed always
Such that other packages can use it for their own testing /
compilation / installation.  Especially the installation prefix is
important.  Probably it is best to make these variables available
using an executable that reports them.

* write a performance analysis framework
Gives an idea of performance optimizations.
** figures out how many cached connections / second can be calculated
** figures out how many memory / cached connection
** figures out how many cached coordinates / second can be calculated
** figures out how many memory / cached coordinate
One possible way to do this is to implement a file, a bit like the
querymachine, that loads a model, does querymachine alike queries,
reports the raw results, and compares the raw results using reported
ratio differences.  So should be done in perl using the swig glue ?

* allow annotations for the coordinate cache
e.g. membrane potentials for color coding for the line segments etc.

* documentation
** ssp
give two extended examples
*** network
*** single cell
** ssp
*** add an overview diagram of how ssp interacts with neurospaces and heccer

* biolevel traversals
** See TraversalInfoCollectorProcessor() developer TODOs.
*** The exclusive traversal traverses segments, and not spines.
*** The exclusive traversal traverses contours, but not em_contours
The em_contours are supposed to translated to undef coordinates that
mark the end of a segment.  Perhaps I should be using a inclusive
traversal starting from molecular level ?

** Get rid of the CHILDREN_TRAVERSAL_FIXED_RETURN flag

** SegmenterSegmentSelector()
** VSegmentSegmentSelector()

* bojum installation problems
** install the model library
/usr/share/neurospaces/models
** take care of proper ssp testing
*** each test has NEUROSPACES_NMC_MODELS hardcoded.
*** tests have references to heccer string tests.
** move the neurospaces studio to the studio package
** move build of /tmp/hierarchy/symbols
Also needs install, studio depends on it

* morphology2ndf
** support to morphology2ndf to read ndf files.
Rename to morphology2morphology in that case.
** output geomview OFF files.
** project configuration
Should be possible to have a local configuration, per project.  The
project browser gives all tools a local configuration file in an
option.  This removes the need for a global library of configuration
options for morphology2ndf (although it is still good to have it, the
global library should actually consist of defaults in /etc as now, and
globals that are looked up automatically in all the project
directories).


* Rationalize algorithm parameters
See what needs to be done for contextworkerinstance and
connectionworkerinstance.
** connectionworkerinstance
Following parameters can be set in connectionworkerinstance:
*** ppistNetwork, phsleNetwork
*** ppistProjection, phsleProjection
*** ppistSource, phsleSource
*** ppistTarget, phsleTarget
*** the instanceof checks
*** setting of random seed
*** Then also:
the calling sequence should be hidden, such that only
ConnectionCheckerConnectionProcessor remains.

* rename projectionquery to projectionindex

* add a parameter library object
fi contains extracellular ca concentration.

* algorithms/event/Makefile.am
* algorithms/symbol/Makefile.am
See developer TODOs.

* 64bit machines
** idin.h
See developer TODOs.
** neurospaces.h
See developer TODOs.

* v_segment should be a segmenter
But need true instrumentation for that.  See developer TODO in
symbols/hierarhcy.

* tests_2_html
** Htmlify the used description files
and link them through the executed command lines, such that the tests
and the model used for the test are linked.
** give an enumeration of the tests that are disabled
and link it through the index site.

* implement algorithms in perl.

* library/pools/purkinje_ca.ndf
The maximum is required for very thin dendrites probably, it would be
better to make thickness dependent on the diameter

* Allow to set a prototype as a conceptual parameter
Not sure, but is likely to introduce consistency problems.  Perhaps
this can be done using a delete and subsequent add operation.  The
purkinje cell comparison uses this pattern a couple of times.

* Try to build a neurospaces amalgation
See http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=TheAmalgamation

* the SwiggableNeurospaces.so object
** should not depend on readline
because of the BC symbol in readline on rhel4 (and probably others
too).

* put the functionality of morphology2ndf in a module.

* The segment relocator relocates segment with one segment off.
The purkinje cell test specs can be used as a starting point.

* population and network
Are derived from segmenter, but the .*GetParameter() implementation
uses Biocomponent as superclass.  Need a good way for superclasses and
respects the instrumentation.

* To build a shared object, need to remove global variables
** parsersupport.c
probably also others, like pifRoot etc.

* configure
** flex and bison are absolute requirements, need a check.

* Could it be that parameter caches do not work together with phyro symbols ?
Seems not, not sure.  There are no tests for it.
Is important for ssp.

* write a I/O checker
** can optionally be called during initialization
** check query machine command 'childreninfo'

* purkinje Kdr
** rename conceptual_gate token to something that makes more sense.
*** steady_state
input is Vm, output is steady_state
*** tua
input is Vm, output is tua

* print out of all time constants of a model
** Takes highest membrane potential or lowest membrane potential for gate time constants
to obtain the fasted time constant

* Have parts of the grammar being generated
** AnySymbol
*** Generated to be any symbol.
*** Annotation is phsle
** .*Component
*** Generated to be allowed symbols for that component
*** Annotation is phsle
*** Empty components must not be generated
** .*Symbol
*** Literal from .*Section
*** Annotation is phsle, needs address of dereference
Simple cast as now overrides compiler type checking.
** .*Section
*** 5 items
**** TOKEN_<component-name>
**** needs identifier
**** I/O, bindables
**** .*Description
**** END
*** Annotation is component-type, no cast
** .*Description
*** 3 or 4 rules
**** empty: allocates empty component-type
**** child: add new child
**** optional subcomponent: add child
**** parameters: add parameters
*** Annotation is component-type, no cast

* Introduce superclass method calls
** SegmentGetParameter()
** PoolGetParameter()

* pool needs a valency parameter
See end of PoolParameterScaleValue().

* Allow to nest a segment inside a segment_group
For integration testing, see library/tests/cells/singlea_naf.ndf

* returns for:
must return a serial or context instead of a symbol.  Has immediate
consequences for Heccer.  I guess I need to do comparable things for
** ParameterResolveFunctionalInput()
** ParameterResolveSymbol()

* neurospaces as a static library & swig
http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/Modules.html#Modules_nn4

* Figure out a way to not include installed files.
See version log of -r 0.853.  Important, can introduce very subtle
bugs.  Can be done by somehow automating a 'make uninstall'.

* segment parameter_scale_value
should be moved to segmenter.
** look for 
//t but the cast should not be here, there is a mismatch in the
//t derivation hierarchy here.
in segment.c

The C structs do not reflect the fact that segment is derived from segmenter.
** The availability of SegmentCountMechanisms() is in contradiction with the SegmenterIsSpherical() in pool.c

* symbol hierarchy instrumentor
** Make sure that concurrent builds are possible
*** Use tempname() or so
** revise 'fixed' methods
e.g. traverse_{wildcard,bio_levels}
*** are those methods that will not be overriden (java 'final')
*** the 'fixed' should be mapped to a piece of code that gets inserted into the function body.
*** object_methods_return_types should be (partially ?) removed for these methods
*** object_methods_signatures only needs 'prototype', but not 'calling'

* Separate source files into
** symbol tree core
** algorithm library
** components, according to the derivation hierarchy
base type, abstract types on the biological path, biological
components, enumeration types (homogeneous), enumeration types
(heterogeneous), purely mathematical types, discrete & combinatorial
types, data model related.
** function library
** parser
** algorithm activator
** glue

* Add code consistency checker for SymbolCalloc() calls
See above, is important because it initializes iTotalAllocatedSymbols.

* Add garbage collection

* See if we can have a 'somatofugal' segment parameter
that returns a list of results.

* Derive from hsle and assign to subspaces
** symtab_Function
** symtab_Parameters
** symtab_AlgorithmSymbol

* Create virtual functions for
** .*SetParent()
** .*IsSpherical()
** .*IsCylindrical()
** .*IsIncoming()
** .*IsOutgoing()
** .*SetDataType()
Perhaps others too.
Perhaps also use double indirection to avoid the pointer bloat.

* initial values
** consolidation
*** Vm_init
*** concen_init
*** state_init
** functionality
compute when not present
using default values when appropriate:
*** compartment
default value: constant
*** concen_init
default value: probably dependent on other values
*** activation_init
dependent on forward and backward steady state values
** documentation
Start writing some documentation about the initial values stream.

* add q10 somewhere
Is comparable to conductance scaling
'printparameteratq10 <symbol> <parameter>'
Q10 = rate at (T + 10 °C)/rate at T
Q10 = (rate1 / rate2) ^ (10 / (T2 - T1))
tau(T) = (tau(T1) / q10_factor) ^ ((T - T1)/10)
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q10_%28temperature_coefficient%29

* units
NaF in paper 7500 mS/cm2
NaF in SI 7500 (S/1000) / (10000/m2)
NaF in model 75000
Neurospaces uses SI units internally, should be documented.

* Overview generator
Add configurator, that allows to extract tables like TABLE1 and
TABLE2 in EDS 1994a.
Should also allow to extract table 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Rapp 1994.

* Tag parameters
** anatomy and morphology axis
dia, length, positions
** physical and mathematical axis
resistance, electrotonic length
** derived axis ?  compound axis ?
volume, surface, see below

* Implement volume and surface
** segment_group
Need true instrumentation for that, see hierarchy/symbols todo comment.
If done, enable the appropriate tests in purkinje.t.

* Implement tests for axon hillock

* write better tests for IO relations between symbols

* Add functions and parameters to main treespace
** evaluate overhead
** evaluate consistency benefit
** fundamental observations
*** connections become symbols with children (parameters)
*** two essentially different types: symbols with and without children
*** functions have regular children
*** all other have regular children

* General data model implementation
Categorize all elements in
** Component Structure Axis
Simple grouping, public vs private models, connections, structured
connections.
** Application Axis
This one has been defined in biolevel.[ch].  It is also related to
parser.rules, .*Component non-terminals.
*** Mathematical
*** Mechanical
*** Magnetical
*** Biological
*** Neurological
*** Anatomical
** Algorithmic Axis
First the algorithm derivation must be finished, I guess ?

* Parmeter caching and algorithms
Implement an algorithm accessible from the library that just sets a
number of parameter caches.

* Allow to define relationships between algorithms
Basically a data flow chart, where the nodes are the algorithms.


* Coordinate transformations
** Reimplement coordinate transformations as virtual calls.
** Add coordinate transformations for foliums

* Rolf kotter database connection
** get database format
** define protocol / interface
** linkup, implement

* MCell related intermediary model representation
** meshing algorithms
Stress difference between conceptual representation and expanded
representation.

* Look into methods for automated annotation
** meshes generated for mcell
** related to transition between modeling and simulation
*** specific resistivity -> cont maths
*** actual / scaled resistivity -> disc maths
same applies to conductances
*** segment length / dia -> cont maths
*** other channel parameters -> ?
*** time constants -> cont maths
because they are related to discretization accuracy
*** segment connectivity -> anatomy
anatomy is at same step as physics & chemistry
*** coordinates -> anatomy

* algorithms that use parameter caches

* implement invisible serial mapping

* implement algorithm activator
Accessible after the whole model has been read

* variable attributes for attachment points
ATTACHMENT_POINT Synapse(OUTPUT activation)
	RECEIVES EVENTS(spike)
	HAS weight = 1.0, delay = DistanceTime(&->PRE,&->POST,3 /* m/s */)
END ATTACHMENT_POINT

& means instantiation, in this case connection attached to (physical) synapse.



* prototypes for groups
** parameters specifications
*** non hierarchical
*** hierarchical



* I/O relations
** grouped components



* check how nernst valency can be made same as pool valency
** list of ions could solve this
** make dependent on new parameter : pool valency
pool valency can in itself be dependent on list of ions



* write out description of model
** option : single file, modular file set
*** single file
Export() for symbol
calls utility functions to do write of header section.
calls utility functions to do write of dependency section.
calls utility functions to do write of start of private model section.
traverse sub-symbols
	processor calls traverse of sub-symbols
	finalizer writes output to file.
		private model start
			sub-symbol (problem with naming ?)
		private model end
calls utility functions to do write of end of private model section.
calls utility functions to do write of start of public model section.
writes alias for symbol.
calls utility functions to do write of end of public model section.


*** modular file set for single symbol
Get ref to defsym
	loop over tagged public models
		loop over tagged private models
			loop over tagged dependency files


*** modular file set for library
Get ref to defsym
	loop over dependency files
		recurse
	loop over private models
	loop over public models


** Neurospaces description files
** Neurospaces XML files



* parsing to pidinstacks
check following :
** namespace parsing
** being rooted
** field references



* add operators

Take a look at the perl regex operators before choosing one, avoid conflicts.
** support needed in pidin.[ch]
** .*Lookup() functions need revision to support functionality

** Needed operators :
*** add operator to address I/O relations (remember I/O lives in same space as
*** parameters and that is a good thing because it makes it possible to make
*** all parameters computable.
'@','=>' are viable candidates
*** add operator to address private models
could be done with namespace operator :: in some special namespace, relate this
to addressing of hypothetical root of private model tree.
'!','&','~', are viable candidates
*** add operator to address dependency file list
'#' like in XPointer paths
