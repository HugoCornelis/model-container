    <h1>The history of Neurospaces</h1>

    It is well known among enterprise software engineers that a
    serious software project cannot be undertaken by starting with the
    implementation of the middle-tier.  Mostly, serious software is
    started by configuring the backends, and, this is, perhaps,
    complemented by implementation of prototype user interfaces.

    The reason I added a paragraph about the history of Neurospaces to
    the website, is to answer this question: how risky is the
    undertaking of the neurospaces project, given it first started
    with the implementation of a middle-tier software component,
    namely Neurospaces ?

    <p>

      Somewhere in the late nineties, the Neosim project was started:
      a project that takes ideas from distributed discrete event
      simulations in telecommunications, and tries to apply these
      ideas to computational neuroscience.  For reasons of efficiency,
      the Neosim people were very interested in using hsolve, the fast
      compartmental solver of Genesis 2.  After a severe analysis,
      interfacing to hsolve proved problematic.  hsolve was (and is)
      unsuccessful in hiding the low-level details of a typical
      solver.  It is difficult to use for implementing complicated
      neuronal models, and for implementing models of experimental
      protocols that must interface to such complicated models.
      (Again, I do not intend to be negative about Genesis or hsolve,
      just trying to explain lessons learned).

    <p>

      Neurospaces started as a namespace for complicated neuronal
      models, as a front end of hsolve, thus dealing with the first
      aforementioned problem.  So, the first software component of the
      neurospaces project, was actually not neurospaces, but hsolve,
      an existing backend.  When I was working in Antwerp, the
      software implementing this namespace, grew to a serious
      scientific project, with branches of neuroinformatics, XML
      databasing and computer science.  The technology of the software
      was put under non-disclosure for some time.

    <p>

      When I started to work in San Antonio, I did a careful analysis
      of the current status of the software project.  Hsolve was
      tightly coupled to Genesis 2, and could hamper further
      developements and it would be difficult to continue the
      Neurospaces project, without a good stand-alone solver.  I was
      in the need of a solver that is not rooted in a full-blown
      simulation monolith.  This was the reason to start implementing
      the Heccer compartmental solver.  Heccer is now as fast as
      hsolve, but does not implement any tricks for interfacing.  As a
      consequence, Heccer really relies on an external environment, to
      specify a model to be simulated.  This model can be defined
      using Neurospaces or from perl (or other scripting languages).

    <p>

      SSP is a simple scheduler, that controls the whole system.  At
      the technical level its main purpose is much more to delegate
      than to 'control'.

      These three software components, Neurospaces, Heccer and SSP,
      can be used as a simple simulator.  It is easy to use (easier
      than Genesis e.g.), and is as performant.  This completes a
      first round in the Neurospaces project.

    <p>

      In the near future, I will probably also concentrate on higher
      level functionality like user interfaces.  This should not be
      difficult, since the current system is driven by declarative
      files.  These files can easily be interpreted, read and written
      by a configuration management framework, like <a
