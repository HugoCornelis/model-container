    </p><h2><a name="section-introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/">GEneral NEural
      SImulation System</a>, GENESIS for short, started as a very
      advanced software package in the late eighties, for biologically
      accurate neuronal modeling.  Besides being used as a neuronal
      simulator, it was also applied to various domains outside
      computational neuroscience.  Right now, the package contains
      ill-structured and duplicate code, inconsistencies prevent
      automatic testing and there is currently a general, yet logical,
      lack of engagement in the neuroscience community to further
      contribute to the package (who wants to contribute if nobody
      else can tell what is and what is not correct and respects the
      fundamental design philosophy of the code ?).  One of the core
      problems responsible for this situation, is that GENESIS is a
      monolithic software system, implementing many different
      user-visible functions.

    <p>
      The <em>Neurospaces project</em> is a departure from the
      monolithic software system design.  It is a development center
      for software components of computational neuroscience
      simulators.  There are many advantages of developing independent
      software components:

    <ul>
	<li>

	  Interfacing to an individual component is obviously more
	  simple than interfacing to a do-all monolithic system.  The
	  compartmental solver developed for the Neurospaces project (<a
	    href="#section-heccer">Heccer<a>) can be connected to Matlab
	      fi.

	<li>

	  It simplifies the individual components and encourages other
	  developers to get involved.

	<li>

	  It allows for separate testing of the components.

	<li>

	  Integrating different component, gives different flavours of
	  the same simulator, and enhances the user experienced
	  consistency when doing multilevel simulations.

	<li>

	  A component based software system avoids vendor-lockin.  Its
	  life-cycle is more smooth than that of a monolithic system,
	  because software components can be upgraded one at a time.

      </ul>

      <p>

	The Neurospaces project embodies many software components that
	all have been developed in full isolation.  Some of the
	components are still in a fluid state of development, for
	others the core is finished.  The current development focus is
	shifting slowly from component integration to the continued
	development of specific components that implement added
	values.

      <p>

	This is a list of software components that have been developed
	or are under construction:

      <ul>

	<li>

	  <a href="#section-heccer">Heccer</a>: a fast compartmental
	  solver, a backend.

	<li>

	  <a href="#section-neurospaces">Neurospaces Model
	  Container</a>.

	<li>

	  <a href="#section-des">Discrete event system</a>: consists
	  of a discrete event distributor and queuer.  This is used
	  for abstract modeling of an action potential as a 'discrete
	  event'.

	<li>

	  <a href="#section-ssp">SSP</a>: a flexible scheduler written
	  in perl, to run simulations with Neurospaces and Heccer.

	<li>

	  The <a href="#section-studio">Neurospaces Studio</a>: some
	  tools for graphical browsing and command line usage.

	<li>

	  The <a href="#section-genesis-sli">Genesis Script Layer</a>:
	  a scripting layer that reads <a
	  href="http://www.genesis-sim.org">Genesis</a> scripts and
	  feeds them to Neurospaces.

	<li>

	  The <a href="#section-geometry">Geometry Library</a> is a
	  general purpose geometry library, with some essential
	  geometrical operators, not commonly found in other
	  geometrical libraries.

	<li>

	  Using the Geometry Library, a <a
	  href="#section-reconstruct">Reconstruct Interface</a> has
	  been written.  This interface supports the conversion of
	  contours exported by the <a
	  href="http://synapses.bu.edu/tools/index.htm">Reconstruct
	  software</a> to the Neurospaces declarative NDF format.

	<li>

	  The <a href="#section-simulation-browser">Neurospaces
	  project browser</a> for browsing projects and inspecting
	  simulation results.

	<li>

	  The <a href="#section-installer-tools">Installer package</a>
	  contains the Neurospaces installer and developer tools that
	  have emerged from developing Neurospaces software
	  components.

      </ul>
      <ul>
	<li>

	  There is also a wiki at <a
	  href="http://code.google.com/">googlecode</a> for the
	  Neurospaces project, with information for developers.  See
	  <a
	  href="http://code.google.com/p/neurospaces/wiki/PageName">http://code.google.com/p/neurospaces/wiki/PageName</a>.

      </ul>

      Together, these tools give an alternative core for the upcoming
      <a href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/G3/">GENESIS 3
      GUI</a>.  Another alternative core for the GENESIS 3 GUI is <a
      href="http://moose-g3.sourceforge.net/">Moose</a>, developed in
      India by the group of Upi Bhalla.

      <p>

	Some software engineers have expressed interest in what
	methodology and technology I use for Neurospaces development.

    </p><h2><a name="section-neurospaces">Neurospaces Model
    Container</a></h2>

      The <em>Neurospaces Model Container</em> is used as an
      abstraction layer on top of a simulator and deals with
      biological entities and end-user concepts instead of
      mathematical equations.  This allows to optimize the numerical
      core separately from the modeling package.

    </p><p>

      The Neurospaces model container API abstracts away all the
      mathematical and computational details of the simulator.
      Optimized to store large models in little memory -- it stores
      neuronal models in a fraction of the memory that would be used
      by conventional simulators -- it allows for automatic
      partitioning of the model such that simulations can be run in
      parallel.  From the modeler's side, Neurospaces will be able to
      import and export NeuroML files, facilitating exchange of models
      and ideas, and fostering computational neuroscience.

    <p>

    <ul>
      <li>

	Covers from the network level down to the mechanism level.
	The perl interface converts and reads in GENESIS .p and SWC
	morphology files.  It converts such models to active models
	when needed (e.g. it can reproduce an exact match with the
	Purkinje cell model, see <a
	href="http://www.tnb.ua.ac.be/publications/pub008/DeSchutterJNeuroPhys94a.pdf">purkinje
	cell model </a>).

      <li>

	Defines models in a purely declarative, extensible language.

      <li>

	Keeps and maintains a conceptual 'algorithmic' representation
	of the model, as well as an expanded representation of the
	model.

      <li>

	Knows about biological entities like cells, populations and
	projections (note that for simulators such entities are
	sometimes commands instead of biological entities).

      <li>

	Annotates the structures and concepts of the model with
	biological, physics and mathematical quantities.

      <li>

	Supports setup of the most complicated mathematical solvers.
	In principle, supports transparant setup of multiscale models
	and simulations (this is work in progress, see also the
	references at the bottom of the page).

      <li>

	Gives different views on the same network model.  These views
	are visualized in the GUI.  Take a look at the <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=162899">screenshots</a>.

      <li>

	Knows about specific parameters vs actual parameters,
	e.g. specific membrane capacitance vs scaled membrane
	capacitance.  Put more generally, the biological objects in
	neurospaces rely on their parent, children and siblings to
	infer a number of their own properties.

      <li>

	Allows for arbitrary nesting of network models, including
	nesting of projections and populations.

      <li>

	Allows to inspect the connectivity of a network model in an
	intuitive way.

      <li>

	Stores huge models in little memory, needed for full model
	inspection and automated validation (the more complicated the
	model the more efficient the compression scheme (from the
	theoretical perspective the compressed image scales
	logarithmically with the original)).

      <li>

	Can save and reload connections between components.  Costly
	computation of connections has to be done only once.

    </ul>

      <p>

	The <a href="CNS2006-workshop/index.html"> presentation given
	at the CNS2006 meeting</a> gives a good view and feeling of
	the functionality of Neurospaces.

      <p>

	Notes:

      <ol>
	<li>

	  This presentation was given before Heccer existed.  Replace
	  Hsolve with Heccer and the global picture looks the same
	  (the reason Hsolve was replaced with Heccer is explained in
	  a brief section about <a href="history.html">history of
	  Neurospaces</a>.

	<li>

	  Just recently the memory performance of neurospaces was
	  proven to be more than 1000 times more efficient than that
	  of GENESIS when storing a Purkinje cell population.  This
	  additional efficiency is in agreement with predictions based
	  on the data structures that are used by Neurospaces.

      </ol>

      <p>

	A word about the <a href="history.html">history of
	Neurospaces</a>.

      <p>

	Neurospaces is constantly undergoing regression tests.  You
	can see the output of these tests <a
	href="neurospaces_project/neurospaces/tests/html/index.html">here</a>.

      <p>

	These tests give an idea of the detailed functionality of
	Neurospaces as a data container.

    </p><h2><a name="section-heccer">Heccer</a></h2>

    The optimization of a neuronal solver consists of ultimate
    accuracy and performance.  Transforming complex biological
    parameters into precomputed tables and optimizing for a high CPU
    cache hit ratio are the most important features for a good solver,
    and gives the solver a performance boost of about a factor four to
    six (the Neuron simulator has recently taken the same approach).

    </p><p>

    <em>Heccer</em> is a fast compartmental solver, that is based on
    <a
    href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/Hyperdoc/Manual-26.html#ss26.34"><em>hsolve</em></a>
    of the <a href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/">GENESIS
    simulator</a>.

    The numerical principles implemented in Heccer are described <a
    href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/gum-tutorials/cornelis/doc/html/node3.html">here</a>.
    Why Heccer is much more efficient that many other compartmental
    solvers currently available is explained <a
    href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/gum-tutorials/cornelis/doc/html/node53.html">here</a>.

    </p><p>

      Heccer can be instantiated from C, or from Perl (or other
      scripting languages).  It is also possible to link Heccer
      directly to Matlab.  Heccer comes with <a
      href="http://www.swig.org">Swig</a> interface definitions, such
      that linking Heccer to any other technologies should be easy.

    </p><p>

	Adding new channel types to Heccer can be done using callouts.
	The callout mechanism allows for general user extensions that
	contribute a current or conductance at a particular time in a
	simulation.  Heccer automatically integrates this contribution
	into the membrane potential.

    </p><p>

      The source code of Heccer contains inline developer
      documentation.  There is no stable API yet, but the <a
      href="http://www.swig.org">Swig</a> interfaces for Heccer are
      not expected to change much.  If you are interested in this,
      look at <a
      href="neurospaces_project/heccer/tests/html/glue/swig/perl/fork4p1.source.html#line51">a
      simple example for driving Heccer from perl</a>, and <a
      href="neurospaces_project/heccer/tests/html/glue/swig/perl/pool1-feedback1.source.html#line51">another
      example with active channels and a calcium pool</a>.  Heccer is
      currently capable of simulating purkinje cells (see <a
      href="http://www.tnb.ua.ac.be/publications/pub008/DeSchutterJNeuroPhys94a.pdf">purkinje
      cell model </a>), and, at first evaluation, runs slightly faster
      than hsolve (It is difficult to assess why exactly: while the
      hsolve implementation is much more optimized than Heccer's, the
      Heccer design is slightly better optimized than Hsolve's.).

    <p>

      Based on the mentioned sets of documentation, more extended
      documentation will be assembled when the time is ripe.

      <li>

	Integrates exponentially decaying calcium concentrations and
	nernst potentials.  Interfaces will be provided for more

      <li>

	Tables to speed up computations, are generated and optimized

      <li>

	All parts of the model with the same kinetics share tables

      <li>

	In the near future, can compute the contribution of one
	channel type to the overall dendritic current.

      <li>

	Can serialize the current neuron state to an external stream
	for later resuming the simulation (or for multiple use).

      <li>

	In combination with the previous point, can be initialized
	from external sources.

      <li>

	Can be used with or without Neurospaces.  To use Heccer
	without neurospaces, configure the package with the command
	line './configure --without-neurospaces'.  To use Heccer with
	Neurospaces, Neurospaces must be installed before Heccer is
	compiled.

    </ul>

    <p>

	Heccer has been validated with a purkinje cell model and
	produces an exact match with hsolve (see <a
	href="http://www.tnb.ua.ac.be/publications/pub008/DeSchutterJNeuroPhys94a.pdf">purkinje
	cell model </a> and the purkinje cell tutorial in the <a
	href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/">GENESIS</a>
	simulator distribution).  Heccer is constantly undergoing
	regression tests.  You can see the output of these tests <a
	href="neurospaces_project/heccer/tests/html/index.html">here</a>.

      <p>

	These tests give an idea of the functionality of Heccer as a
	compartmental solver.

    <p>
	Besides being open source, Heccer is also hypersource.  The
	Heccer source code can be browsed <a
	href="neurospaces_project/heccer/html_source/heccer/source/c/snapshots/0/index.html">here</a>.
	An example test file with points of entry into Heccer, can be

    </p><h2><a name="section-des">DES: the discrete event
    system</a></h2>

      The <em>D</em>iscrete <em>E</em>vent <em>S</em>ystem is used for
      abstract modeling of action potentials.  This functionality is
      needed for running network simulations.  Action potentials
      generated at the soma of one neuron, are translated to a
      discrete event, that is delivered at a synaptic target of a
      connected neuron.  The DES component borrows ideas from previous
      research in discrete event simulation.

      <p>

	From a software architecture viewpoint, DES is a separate
	solver: it simulates action potential propagation in an
	efficient way.  Splitting this functionality from the rest of
	the simulator, facilitates customization for modeling of
	sophisticated learning rules, especially related to STDP,
	diffusion and spillover.

      <p>

	Internally, the discrete event system contains two
	subcomponents, one component for event distribution that
	contains a connectivity matrix, a second component for event
	queuing.

      </p><h3><a name="section-features-des">Features:</a></h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
	<li>

	  delivers a single event to many targets.

	<li>

	  queues the event whenever applicable.

	<li>

	  allows for easy customization, e.g. to associate 'secondary'
	  data with a connection, like weight, delay and other data
	  specific for the model.

      </ul>

      <p>

	Note: at the time of writing this component is distributed as
	part of the Heccer package.  This is likely to change in the
	near future.

    </p><h2><a name="section-ssp">SSP</a></h2>

      Neurospaces, Heccer and DES are stand-alone components.  They
      need to be glued together before they are useful.  Besides that,
      they also need to be activated correctly, such that they can
      work together on a single simulation.  This is exactly what the
      <em>SSP</em> scheduler does.

      The <em>S</em>imple <em>S</em>cheduler in <em>P</em>erl,
      activates other software components according to a configurable
      schedule.  Because the SSP scheduler does not have any
      computational load, its implementation is very simple, and
      configurable.  It is actually the configuration that connects
      SSP to Neurospaces and Heccer.  Other configurations will
      connect SSP to other modeling services or solvers.  SSP achieves
      this by loading on the fly, the integration modules that are
      referenced in its configuration.  Other modules are not loaded.

      <p>

	Below is a typical configuration file for SSP.  It first
	configures SSP to use Neurospaces as the modeling service.
	Then, it instructs SSP to load a model called
	'cells/tensizesp.ndf', and to instantiate a solver called
	'Heccer' for a part of the model (namely '/tensizesp').

	The simulation of the model is run using the 'apply' entry in
	the configuration file (note that the order in the
	configuration file is alphabetical, not chronological.  A user
	may specify the entries in any order that he chooses.).

      <pre>

    - arguments:
        - 10

      Below is a slightly enhanced SSP configuration file.
      Additionally, this file also shows how to pass specific options
      to Heccer: Heccer will give a small report after every time step
      in the simulation, and the time step is set to a new value.

      This configuraton file also specifies the output classes and
      actual outputs of the simulation.  The specified outputs are
      written to a file in the file system (in this case using a

      The <em>Neurospaces studio</em> is a front-end to the

	neurospaces does shrinkage correction on the fly.

      <pre>
$ neurospaces morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p --shrinkage 1.111111 --traversal-symbol / --reporting-field G_MAX --condition '$d->{context} =~ /kdr/i'
calling morphology2ndf  --shrinkage 1.111111 morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p >/tmp/i0a37qeDQl
neurospaces: No errors for /tmp/i0a37qeDQl.

      </pre>

      <p>

	A second example, showing how many spines get attached to the
	morphology:

      <pre>
$ neurospaces morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p --spine Purk_spine --algo Spines
calling morphology2ndf  --spine-prototypes Purk_spine --shrinkage 1 morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p >/tmp/3YWitXpVmH
neurospaces: No errors for /tmp/3YWitXpVmH.


SpinesInstance          Spines__0__Purk_spine :
-----------------------------------------------
        Number of added/virtual spines : 1984/131729.077346
        Number of tries (adding spines) : 1984
        Number of failures (adding spines) : 0
        SpinesInstance prototype : Purk_spine
        SpinesInstance surface : 1.33079e-12
      </pre>

      <p></p>

      And now again, but with shrinkage correction:

      <pre>
$ neurospaces morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p --shrinkage 1.111111 --spine Purk_spine --algo Spines
calling morphology2ndf  --spine-prototypes Purk_spine --shrinkage 1.111111 morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p >/tmp/mCz74N5CvO
neurospaces: No errors for /tmp/mCz74N5CvO.


SpinesInstance          Spines__0__Purk_spine :
-----------------------------------------------
        Number of added/virtual spines : 1969/145163.160838
        Number of tries (adding spines) : 1969
        Number of failures (adding spines) : 0
        SpinesInstance prototype : Purk_spine
        SpinesInstance surface : 1.33079e-12
      </pre>

      So when applying shrinkage correction, you get fewer spiny
      dendrites that get fewer physical spines.  Nevertheless the
      compartments are longer, such that more surface correction for
      the spiny dendrites has been done.  Read the documentation of <a
      href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/Hyperdoc/Manual-25.html#ss25.131">the
      GENESIS cell reader</a> (specifically the section on spines) for
      more information on how exactly the spines get attached to a
      morphology and how dendritic surface scaling works.

    <p></p>

      It is also possible to calculate total dendritic surface, or
      total dendritic spine surface:

      <pre>
$ neurospaces morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p --shrinkage 1.111111 --spine Purk_spine --traversal / --type '^T_sym_segment$' --reporting-field SURFACE --cumulate
$ neurospaces morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p --shrinkage 1.111111 --spine Purk_spine --traversal / --type '^T_sym_segment$' --reporting-field SURFACE --condition '$d->{context} =~ /Purk_spine/i' --cumulate 
      </pre>

      Now you can easily compare the total dendritic surface area, and
      compare it with the total spines area, and see if your model
      makes sense.

      <p></p>

      Here is the command line I use when looking for segments with a
      particular combination of diameter and length.  As you can see I
      am not interested in segments from spines:

      <pre>
$ neurospaces cells/purkinje/edsjb1994.ndf --traversal-symbol / --reporting-field LENGTH --reporting-field DIA --type 'segment' --condition '$d->{context} !~ /spine/i' | less
      </pre>

      Instead of using 'less' or 'more' to browse the results, you can
      obviously also do a 'grep' or feed everything to a file and then
      open the file in a editor.  This tool obviously supports many
      other use cases.

      <p>

	The Neurospaces studio is constantly undergoing regression
	tests.  You can see the output of these tests <a
	href="neurospaces_project/studio/tests/html/index.html">here</a>.

      <p>

	These tests give an idea of the functionality of the
	Neurospaces studio for examining complicated neuronal models.

      <p>

	PS: most (but not all) of this front-end used to be
	distributed with the Neurospaces model container, for legacy
	reasons.  This introduced ambiguity in the packaging system,
	and a number of installation problems.  Factoring out the
	studio solves those problems.

    </p><h2><a name="section-genesis-sli">Genesis Script Layer</a></h2>

      The <em>Genesis Script Layer</em> is a scripting interface that
      reads <a href="http://www.genesis-sim.org">Genesis</a> scripts
      and feeds them to Neurospaces software components.  The Genesis
      scripts that create a model and run a simulation in Genesis,
      will also create a model and run a simulation in Neurospaces.

      <p>

	In principle, this component is a specific version of the
	Genesis simulator that binds to Neurospaces components, and
	delegates all model construction statements to the <a
	href="#section-neurospaces">Neurospaces model container</a>,
	delegates simulation management statements to <a
	href="#section-ssp">SSP</a>, and delegates statements related
	to temporal accuracy to <a href="#section-heccer">Heccer</a>.

      <p>

	GUI and XODUS related statements are under consideration for
	support to.

      <p>

	This component is currently under construction.

    </p><h2><a name="section-geometry">Geometry Library</a></h2>

      The <em>Geometry Library</em> is a general purpose geometry
      library, with some essential geometrical operators, not commonly
      found in other geometrical libraries.  It gives a low-level data
      representation of 3D and 2D lines, and defines operations on
      them like volume, surface and intersection calculations.  This
      library is meant to be a gateway for more complex operations too
      (like dendritic surface reconstruction from a stack of EM
      images).

<!--       <p> -->

<!-- 	The geometry library is constantly undergoing regression -->
<!-- 	tests.  You can see the output of these tests <a -->
<!-- 	href="neurospaces_project/geometry/tests/html/index.html">here</a>. -->

<!--       <p> -->

<!-- 	These tests give an idea of the functionality of geometry -->
<!-- 	library. -->

      </p><h2><a name="section-reconstruct">Reconstruct Interface</a></h2>

      The Reconstruct Interface reads XML files written by the <a
      href="http://synapses.bu.edu/tools/index.htm">Reconstruct
      software</a>, and writes it out to Neurospaces declarative NDF
      format.  This involves geometrical operations, so this interface
      relies on the Geometry Library.  The interface allows to
      separate out contours with different tags.

    </p><h2><a name="section-simulation-browser">Neurospaces Project Browser</a></h2>

      The <em>Neurospaces project browser</em> is a set of modules for
      the <a href="http://www.webmin.com/usermin.html">Usermin web
      server</a>.  This allows you to browse projects, inspect, and
      compare simulation results or other data over a web interface.

      <p>

	The specific aims of the project browser are introduced in <a
	href="CNS2007-workshop/index.html">the presentation given at
	the model sharing workshop at the CNS*2007 meeting in
	Toronto</a>.

      <p>

	The project browser uses distributed version control
	mechanisms to physically distribute your project.  The
	coupling to a web server allows to inspect your simulations
	and compare results, regardless of location.

	You can take a look at the <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=162899">screenshots</a>.

    </p><h2><a name="section-installer-tools">Installer
    Package</a></h2>

      The <em>Installer Package</em> contains the Neurospaces
      Installer and developer tools that have emerged from developing
      Neurospaces software components.  This package has a number of
      generally useful utilities and is currently (December 2007)
      growing quickly.

    </p><h2><a name="section-developer">Additional background information</a></h2>

      <ul>

	<li>

	  The Neurospaces project develops software components that
	  match with the <a href="./cbi.png">CBI simulator
	  architecture</a>, which is also used in GENESIS 3 as a
	  common framework.  Despite the apparant size of this
	  project, already many components have been developed and
	  integrated into a working simulator (more information to
	  follow, yet see also the poster presentation at the Society
	  for Neuroscience Meeting, November 2007)

	<li>

	  The Neurospaces project encompasses an increasing number of
	  projects.  So correct and consistent deployment becomes more
	  important.  The <a
	  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">autotools</a>
	  do a lot of things automatically.  I try to develop tools
	  that are compliant with the <a
	  href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy
	  Standard</a>.

	<li>

	  Neurospaces uses a mixture of XML indexing and node
	  identification techniques.  I should give a pointer here to
	  relevant background information.

	<li>

	  At the data modeling level, none of the lower-level tools
	  presented here make a difference between data and meta-data,
	  because it is in the end the application that must make this
	  difference.  As a result, all data formats developed for the
	  Neurospaces project allow easy information extraction from
	  the application data as well as the application 'meta-data'.
	  If such statements are more like English Chinese to you, and
	  you think it is important to understand these subtle
	  differences, see e.g. <a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">this entry in
	  wikipedia</a>.  In neuroscience modeling, these differences
	  are extremely important, simply because any model has
	  numerous builtin assumptions about its immediate
	  environment.  So there is no explicit separation possible
	  between the different dimensions of the data.
