    </p><h2><a name="section-introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
    <p>

      The <a href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/">GEneral NEural
      SImulation System</a>, GENESIS for short, started as a very
      advanced software package in the late eighties, for biologically
      accurate neuronal modeling.  Besides being used as a neuronal
      simulator, it was also applied to various domains outside
      computational neuroscience.  Right now, the package contains
      ill-structured and duplicate code, inconsistencies prevent
      automatic testing and there is currently a general, yet logical,
      lack of engagement in the neuroscience community to further
      contribute to the package (who wants to contribute if nobody
      else can tell what is and what is not correct and respects the
      fundamental design philosophy of the code ?).  One of the core
      problems responsible for this situation, is that GENESIS is a
      monolithic software system, implementing many different
      user-visible functions.

    <p>

      The <em>Neurospaces project</em> is a departure from the
      monolithic software system design.  It is a development center
      for software components of computational neuroscience
      simulators.  There are many advantages of developing independent
      software components:

    <ul>
	<li>

	  Interfacing to an individual component is obviously more
	  simple than interfacing to a do-all monolithic system.  The
	  compartmental solver developed for the Neurospaces project (<a
	    href="#section-heccer">Heccer<a>) can be connected to Matlab
	      fi.

	<li>

	  It simplifies the individual components and encourages other
	  developers to get involved.

	<li>

	  It allows for separate testing of the components.  More than
	  1500 use case <a href="tests-menu.html">tests</a> been
	  defined for these software components, including integration
	  tests.

	<li>

	  Integrating different component, gives different flavours of
	  the same simulator, and enhances the user experienced
	  consistency when doing multilevel simulations.

	<li>

	  A component based software system avoids vendor-lockin.  Its
	  life-cycle is more smooth than that of a monolithic system,
	  because software components can be upgraded one at a time.

      </ul>

      <p>

	The Neurospaces project embodies many software components that
	all have been developed in full isolation.  The core of the
	most important components is finished.  The current
	development focus has shifted from component integration to
	the support of specific use case with an emphasis on single
	neuron modeling.

      <p>

	This is a list of software components that have been developed
	or are under construction:

      <ul>

	<li>

	  <a href="#section-gshell">GShell</a>: an interactive
	  front-end that integrates with other software components.

	<li>

	  <a href="#section-heccer">Heccer</a>: a fast compartmental
	  solver, a backend.

	<li>

	  <a href="#section-dash">Dash</a>: a second compartmental
	  solver faster than Heccer, for simpler models.

	<li>

	  <a href="#section-neurospaces">Neurospaces Model
	  Container</a>: provides a solver independent internal and
	  external storage format for models.

	<li>

	  <a href="#section-exchange">The Exchange Module:</a>:
	  provides the model-container with interfaces to XML based
	  model descriptions such as <a
	  href="http://www.neuroml.org/">NeuroML</a> and <a
	  href="http://www.nineml.org/">NineML</a>.

	<li>

	  <a href="#section-des">Discrete event system</a>: consists
	  of a discrete event distributor and queuer.  This is used
	  for abstract modeling of an action potential traveling
	  inside an axon as a 'discrete event'.

	<li>

	  <a href="#section-ssp">SSP</a>: a flexible scheduler written
	  in perl, to run simulations with the Neurospaces model
	  container and Heccer.

	<li>

	  The <a href="#section-studio">Neurospaces Studio</a>: some
	  tools for graphical browsing and command line usage.

	<li>

	  The <a href="#section-genesis-sli">Genesis Script Language
	  Interface</a>: a scripting component that reads <a
	  href="http://www.genesis-sim.org">Genesis 2</a> scripts and
	  feeds them to the Neurospaces model container.

	<li>

	  The <a href="#section-geometry">Geometry Library</a> is a
	  general purpose geometry library, with some essential
	  geometrical operators, not commonly found in other
	  geometrical libraries.

	<li>

	  Using the Geometry Library, a <a
	  href="#section-reconstruct">Reconstruct Interface</a> has
	  been written.  This interface supports the conversion of
	  contours exported by the <a
	  href="http://synapses.bu.edu/tools/index.htm">Reconstruct
	  software</a> to the Neurospaces declarative NDF format.

	<li>

	  The <a href="#section-simulation-browser">Neurospaces
	  project browser</a> for browsing projects and inspecting
	  simulation results.

	<li>

	  The <a href="#section-installer-tools">Developer Package</a>
	  contains the Neurospaces installer and developer tools that
	  have emerged from developing Neurospaces software
	  components.

	<li>

	  The <a href="#section-configurator">Configurator package</a>
	  contains configuration utilities for the other tools.  It is
	  not needed for the other tools to work properly.  Rather, it
	  allows to set up model database and simulation servers in a
	  convenient way.

      </ul>
      <ul>
	<li>

	  There is also a <a
	  href="http://neurospaces.blogspot.com/">Neurospaces blog</a>
	  and a <a
	  href="http://code.google.com/p/neurospaces/wiki/Index">wiki
	  at googlecode</a> for the Neurospaces project, with
	  information for developers.

      </ul>

      Together, these tools give the core for the upcoming <a
      href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/G3/">GENESIS 3 GUI</a>.
      Another alternative core for the GENESIS 3 GUI is <a
      href="http://moose-g3.sourceforge.net/">Moose</a>, developed in
      India by the group of Upi Bhalla.

    </p><h2><a name="section-neurospaces">Neurospaces Model
    Container</a></h2>

      The <em>Neurospaces Model Container</em> is used as an
      abstraction layer on top of a simulator and deals with
      biological entities and end-user concepts instead of
      mathematical equations.  It provides a solver independent
      internal storage format for models to allow user invisible
      optimizations of the numerical core.  By 'containing' the
      biological model, the model container reliefs the implementation
      of the numerical core from the software implementation pressures
      typically associated with heterogeneously structured data such
      as dendritic morphologies.

    </p><p>

      The Neurospaces model container API abstracts away all the
      mathematical and computational details of the simulator.
      Optimized to store large models in little memory -- it stores
      neuronal models in a fraction of the memory that would be used
      by conventional simulators -- it allows for automatic
      partitioning of the model such that simulations can be run in
      parallel.  From the modeler's side, Neurospaces will be able to
      import and export NeuroML files, facilitating exchange of models
      and ideas, and fostering computational neuroscience.


    </p><h3><a name="section-features-neurospaces">Features:</a></h3>

    <p>

    <ul>
      <li>

	Covers from the network level down to the mechanism level.
	The perl interface converts and reads in GENESIS .p and SWC
	morphology files.  It converts such models to active models
	when needed (e.g. it can reproduce an exact match with the
	Purkinje cell model, see <a
	href="http://www.tnb.ua.ac.be/publications/pub008/DeSchutterJNeuroPhys94a.pdf">purkinje
	cell model </a>).

      <li>

	Defines models in a purely declarative, extensible language.

      <li>

	Keeps and maintains a conceptual 'algorithmic' representation
	of the model, as well as an expanded representation of the
	model.

      <li>

	Knows about biological entities like cells, populations and
	projections (note that for simulators such entities are
	sometimes commands instead of biological entities).

      <li>

	Annotates the structures and concepts of the model with
	biological, physics and mathematical quantities.

      <li>

	Supports setup of the most complicated mathematical solvers.
	In principle, supports transparant setup of multiscale models
	and simulations (this is work in progress, see also the
	references at the bottom of the page).

      <li>

	Gives different views on the same network model.  These views
	are visualized in the GUI.  Take a look at the <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/project/screenshots.php?group_id=162899">screenshots</a>.

      <li>

	Knows about specific parameters vs actual parameters,
	e.g. specific membrane capacitance vs scaled membrane
	capacitance.  Put more generally, the biological objects in
	the model container rely on their parent, children and
	siblings to infer a number of their own properties.

      <li>

	Allows for arbitrary nesting of network models, including
	nesting of projections and populations.

      <li>

	Allows to inspect the connectivity of a network model in an
	intuitive way.

      <li>

	Stores huge models in little memory, needed for full model
	inspection and automated validation (the more complicated the
	model the more efficient the compression scheme (from the
	theoretical perspective the compressed image scales
	logarithmically with the original)).

      <li>

	Can save and reload connections between components.  Costly
	computation of connections has to be done only once.

    </ul>

      <p>

	The <a href="CNS2006-workshop/index.html"> presentation given
	at the CNS2006 meeting</a> gives a good view and feeling for
	the functionality of the model container.

      <p>

	Notes:

      <ol>
	<li>

	  This presentation was given before Heccer existed.  Replace
	  Hsolve with Heccer and the global picture looks the same
	  (the reason Hsolve was replaced with Heccer is explained in
	  a brief section about <a href="history.html">history of the
	  Neurospaces Model Container</a>.

	<li>

	  Just recently the memory performance of the Neurospaces
	  model container was proven to be more than 1000 times more
	  efficient than that of GENESIS when storing a Purkinje cell
	  population.  This additional efficiency is in agreement with
	  predictions based on the data structures that are used by
	  the model container.

      </ol>

      <p>

	A word about the <a href="history.html">history of the
	Neurospaces model container</a>.

      <p>

	The model container is constantly undergoing regression tests.
	You can see the output of these tests <a
	href="neurospaces_project/neurospaces/tests/html/index.html">here</a>.

      <p>

	These tests give an idea of the functionality of the model
	container as an internal storage format for biologically
	realistic models.

    </p><h2><a name="section-exchange">The Exchange Module</a></h2>

      The Exchange Module is a system for convenient interfacing to
      XML based model descriptions such as <a
      href="http://www.neuroml.org/">NeuroML</a> and <a
      href="http://www.nineml.org/">NineML</a>.

    </p><h2><a name="section-heccer">Heccer</a></h2>

    The optimization of a neuronal solver consists of ultimate
    accuracy and performance.  Transforming complex biological
    parameters into precomputed tables and optimizing for a high CPU
    cache hit ratio are the most important features for a good solver,
    and gives the solver a performance boost of about a factor four to
    six (the Neuron simulator has recently taken the same approach).

    </p><p>

    <em>Heccer</em> is a fast compartmental solver, that is based on
    <a
    href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/Hyperdoc/Manual-26.html#ss26.34"><em>hsolve</em></a>
    of the <a href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/">GENESIS
    simulator</a>.

    The numerical principles implemented in Heccer are described <a
    href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/gum-tutorials/cornelis/doc/html/node3.html">here</a>.
    Why Heccer is much more efficient that many other compartmental
    solvers currently available is explained <a
    href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/gum-tutorials/cornelis/doc/html/node53.html">here</a>.

    </p><p>

      Heccer can be instantiated from C, or from Perl (or other
      scripting languages).  It is also possible to link Heccer
      directly to Matlab.  Heccer comes with <a
      href="http://www.swig.org">Swig</a> interface definitions, such
      that linking Heccer to any other technologies should be easy.

    </p><p>

	Adding new channel types to Heccer can be done using callouts.
	The callout mechanism allows for general user extensions that
	contribute a current or conductance at a particular time in a
	simulation.  Heccer automatically integrates this contribution
	into the membrane potential.

    </p><p>

      The source code of Heccer contains inline developer
      documentation.  There is no stable API yet, but the <a
      href="http://www.swig.org">Swig</a> interfaces for Heccer are
      not expected to change much.  If you are interested in this,
      look at <a
      href="neurospaces_project/heccer/tests/html/glue/swig/perl/fork4p1.source.html#line51">a
      simple example for driving Heccer from perl</a>, and <a
      href="neurospaces_project/heccer/tests/html/glue/swig/perl/pool1-feedback1.source.html#line51">another
      example with active channels and a calcium pool</a>.  Heccer is
      currently capable of simulating purkinje cells (see <a
      href="http://www.tnb.ua.ac.be/publications/pub008/DeSchutterJNeuroPhys94a.pdf">purkinje
      cell model </a>), and, at first evaluation, runs slightly faster
      than hsolve (It is difficult to assess why exactly: while the
      hsolve implementation is much more optimized than Heccer's, the
      Heccer design is slightly better optimized than Hsolve's.).

    <p>

      Based on the mentioned sets of documentation, more extended
      documentation will be assembled when the time is ripe.

    </p><h3><a name="section-features-heccer">Features:</a></h3>

      <li>

	All parts of the model with the same kinetics share tables

	channels or the contribution of all persistent calcium
	channels.

      <li>

	Can serialize the current neuron state to an external stream
	for later resuming the simulation (or for multiple use).

      <li>

	In combination with the previous point, can be initialized
	from external sources.

      <li>

	Can be used with or without the Neurospaces model container.
	To use Heccer without the Neurospaces model container,
	configure the package with the command line './configure
	--without-neurospaces'.  To use Heccer with the model
	container, the model container must be installed before Heccer
	is compiled.

    </ul>

    <p>

	Heccer has been validated with a purkinje cell model and
	produces an exact match with hsolve (see <a
	href="http://www.tnb.ua.ac.be/publications/pub008/DeSchutterJNeuroPhys94a.pdf">purkinje
	cell model </a> and the purkinje cell tutorial in the <a

      <p>

	These tests give an idea of the functionality of Heccer as a
	compartmental solver.

    <p>
	Besides being open source, Heccer is also hypersource.  The
	Heccer source code can be browsed <a

      An alternative way to run models very fast is by limiting the

      solver is not as sophisticated as <a
      href="#section-heccer">Heccer<a>, but can easily be used for
      network simulations.  This solver was contributed to the
      Neurospaces project by Allan D. Coop (see <a

    </p><h2><a name="section-des">DES: the discrete event
    system</a></h2>

      The <em>D</em>iscrete <em>E</em>vent <em>S</em>ystem is used for
      abstract modeling of action potentials.  This functionality is
      needed for running network simulations.  Action potentials
      generated at the soma of one neuron, are translated to a
      discrete event, that is delivered at a synaptic target of a
      connected neuron.  The DES component borrows ideas from previous
      research in discrete event simulation.

      <p>

	From a software architecture viewpoint, DES is a separate
	solver: it simulates action potential propagation in an
	efficient way.  Splitting this functionality from the rest of
	the simulator, facilitates customization for modeling of
	sophisticated learning rules, especially related to STDP,
	diffusion and spillover.

      <p>

	Internally, the discrete event system contains two
	subcomponents, one component for event distribution that
	contains a connectivity matrix, a second component for event
	queuing.

      </p><h3><a name="section-features-des">Features:</a></h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
	<li>

	  delivers a single event to many targets.

	<li>

	  queues the event whenever applicable.

	<li>

	  allows for easy customization, e.g. to associate 'secondary'
	  data with a connection, like weight, delay and other data
	  specific for the model.

      </ul>

      <p>

	Note: at the time of writing this component is distributed as
	part of the Heccer package.  This is likely to change in the
	near future.

    </p><h2><a name="section-ssp">SSP</a></h2>

      The model container, Heccer and DES are stand-alone components.
      They need to be glued together before they are useful.  Besides
      that, they also need to be activated correctly, such that they
      can work together on a single simulation.  This is exactly what
      the <em>SSP</em> scheduler does.

      The <em>S</em>imple <em>S</em>cheduler in <em>P</em>erl,
      activates other software components according to a configurable
      schedule.  Because the SSP scheduler does not have any
      computational load, its implementation is very simple, and
      configurable.  It is actually the configuration that instructs
      SSP to load the model container and Heccer, and to activate them
      for a simulation.  Other configurations will connect SSP to
      other modeling services or solvers.  SSP achieves this by
      loading on the fly those software modules referenced in its
      configuration.  Other modules are not loaded.

      <p>

	Below is a typical configuration file for SSP.  It first
	configures SSP to use the model container for internal storage
	(called Neurospaces for legacy reasons).  It then instructs
	SSP to load a model called 'cells/tensizesp.ndf', and to
	instantiate a solver called 'Heccer' for that part of the
	model ('/tensizesp').

	The simulation of the model is run using the 'apply' entry in
	the configuration file (note that the order in the
	configuration file is alphabetical, not chronological.  A user
	may specify these entries in any order.).

      <pre>

      Below is a slightly enhanced SSP configuration file.
      Additionally, this file also shows how to pass specific options
      to Heccer: Heccer will give a small report after every time step
      in the simulation, and the time step is set to a new value.

      This configuraton file also specifies the output classes and
      actual outputs of the simulation.  The specified outputs are
      written to a file in the file system (in this case using a

    <p>

    <ul>
      <li>

	Uses declarative configuration files, and can be driven from
	scripts.

      <li>

	Integrates other components into a consistent API for user
	interfaces.  SSP is not aware of the internal details of the
	model container or Heccer aware, but loads their functions on
	the fly, and only if needed.

      <li>

	Allows to set options for the backends (e.g. the time step of
	integration for Heccer).

      <li>

	Has hooks for setting model parameters before the model is
	run.  This can be used for parameter searches (e.g. see <a
	href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/neurofitter">neurofitter</a>).

      </ul>

      <p>

	SSP is constantly undergoing regression tests.  You can see
	the output of these tests <a
	href="neurospaces_project/ssp/tests/html/index.html">here</a>.

      <p>

	These tests are SSP stand-alone tests, and integration tests
	with the Neurospaces model container and Heccer.

    </p><h2><a name="section-studio">Neurospaces Studio</a></h2>

      The <em>Neurospaces studio</em> has a GUI front-end to the
      Neurospaces model container and allows browsing and
      visualization of the model.  Note that the Neurospaces studio is
      not a graphical editor or construction kit.  I prefer to rely on
      external applications for this type of functionality, a good
      example is <a
      href="http://www.neuroconstruct.org/">neuroConstruct</a>.

    </p><p>

	Additionally, the Neurospaces studio comes with a shell
	command that uses the Neurospaces model container <a
	href="http://www.swig.org">Swig</a> bindings to get access to
	the model stored by the model container.

      </p><h3><a name="section-features-studio">Features:</a></h3>

      <p>

      <ul>
	<li>

	  Visualizes models stored by the model container.

	<li>

	  Allows to query a model from a shell command line.

	<li>

	  Is being used for a Purkinje cell comparison study, yet

      </ul>

      <p>

	The studio is a necessary part of the project browser.  It is
	being used at this moment for a purkinje cell comparison
	study.

	Below is an example of the command line tool to inspect the
	delayed rectifier conductance after conversion of a passive
	purkinje cell morphology to an active model.  Also note how
	shrinkage correction is done on the fly.

      <pre>
$ neurospaces morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p --shrinkage 1.111111 --traversal-symbol / --reporting-field G_MAX --condition '$d->{context} =~ /kdr/i'
calling morphology2ndf  --shrinkage 1.111111 morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p >/tmp/i0a37qeDQl
neurospaces: No errors for /tmp/i0a37qeDQl.
/gp_pc1/segments/soma/kdr->G_MAX = 6000
/gp_pc1/segments/p0b1[0]/kdr->G_MAX = 600
/gp_pc1/segments/p0b1[1]/kdr->G_MAX = 600
/gp_pc1/segments/p0b1[2]/kdr->G_MAX = 600
/gp_pc1/segments/p0b1[3]/kdr->G_MAX = 600
/gp_pc1/segments/p0b1b2[0]/kdr->G_MAX = 600
/gp_pc1/segments/p0b1b2b2[0]/kdr->G_MAX = 600
/gp_pc1/segments/p0b1b2b2[1]/kdr->G_MAX = 600

/gp_pc1/segments/p0b1b2b2b2[0]/kdr->G_MAX = 600
Traversal ok
      </pre>

      <p>

	A second example, showing how many spines get attached to the
	morphology:

      <pre>
$ neurospaces morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p --spine Purk_spine --algo Spines
calling morphology2ndf  --spine-prototypes Purk_spine --shrinkage 1 morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p >/tmp/3YWitXpVmH
neurospaces: No errors for /tmp/3YWitXpVmH.


SpinesInstance          Spines__0__Purk_spine :
-----------------------------------------------
        Number of added/virtual spines : 1984/131729.077346
        Number of tries (adding spines) : 1984
        Number of failures (adding spines) : 0
        SpinesInstance prototype : Purk_spine
        SpinesInstance surface : 1.33079e-12
      </pre>

      <p></p>

      And now again, but with shrinkage correction:

      <pre>
$ neurospaces morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p --shrinkage 1.111111 --spine Purk_spine --algo Spines
calling morphology2ndf  --spine-prototypes Purk_spine --shrinkage 1.111111 morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p >/tmp/mCz74N5CvO
neurospaces: No errors for /tmp/mCz74N5CvO.


SpinesInstance          Spines__0__Purk_spine :
-----------------------------------------------
        Number of added/virtual spines : 1969/145163.160838
        Number of tries (adding spines) : 1969
        Number of failures (adding spines) : 0
        SpinesInstance prototype : Purk_spine
        SpinesInstance surface : 1.33079e-12
      </pre>

      So when applying shrinkage correction, you get fewer spiny
      dendrites that get fewer physical spines.  Nevertheless the
      compartments are longer, such that more surface correction for
      the spiny dendrites has been done.  Read the documentation of <a
      href="http://www.genesis-sim.org/GENESIS/Hyperdoc/Manual-25.html#ss25.131">the
      GENESIS cell reader</a> (specifically the section on spines) for
      more information on how exactly the spines get attached to a
      morphology and how dendritic surface scaling works.

    <p></p>

      It is also possible to calculate total dendritic surface, or
      total dendritic spine surface:

      <pre>
$ neurospaces morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p --shrinkage 1.111111 --spine Purk_spine --traversal / --type '^T_sym_segment$' --reporting-field SURFACE --cumulate
$ neurospaces morphologies/genesis/gp_pc1.p --shrinkage 1.111111 --spine Purk_spine --traversal / --type '^T_sym_segment$' --reporting-field SURFACE --condition '$d->{context} =~ /Purk_spine/i' --cumulate 
      </pre>

      Now you can easily compare the total dendritic surface area, and
      compare it with the total spines area, and see if your model
      makes sense.

      <p></p>

      Here is the command line I use when looking for segments with a
      particular combination of diameter and length.  As you can see I
      am not interested in segments from spines:

      <pre>
$ neurospaces cells/purkinje/edsjb1994.ndf --traversal-symbol / --reporting-field LENGTH --reporting-field DIA --type 'segment' --condition '$d->{context} !~ /spine/i' | less
      </pre>

      Instead of using 'less' or 'more' to browse the results, you can
      obviously also do a 'grep' or feed everything to a file and then
      open the file in a editor.  This tool obviously supports many
      other use cases.

      <p>

	The Neurospaces studio is constantly undergoing regression
	tests.  You can see the output of these tests <a
	href="neurospaces_project/studio/tests/html/index.html">here</a>.

      <p>

	These tests give an idea of the functionality of the
	Neurospaces studio for examining complicated neuronal models.

    </p><h2><a name="section-gshell">Genesis 3 Shell</a></h2>

      The <em>Genesis 3 Shell</em> is a simple replacement for the
      Genesis 2 SLI.  It is not meant to be a full replacement, but
      rather allows to initiate modeling projects rather than
      construct complex models from scratch.  The model description
      and simulation configuration can be exported to the project
      browser when the modeling project becomes mature.  One of the
      main targets of the gshell is to become a communication
      abstraction layer on top of the model-container / Heccer / SSP.
      <p>

      The <em>Genesis 2 Script Layer</em> is a scripting interface
      that reads <a href="http://www.genesis-sim.org">Genesis 2
      SLI</a> scripts and feeds them to Neurospaces software
      components.  The Genesis scripts that create a model and run a
      simulation in Genesis, also create a model and run a simulation
      in Neurospaces.

      <p>

	From principle, this component is a reconfigured version of
	the Genesis 2 simulator that binds to Neurospaces components
	for the real work.  It delegates all model construction
	statements to the <a href="#section-neurospaces">Neurospaces
	model container</a>, delegates simulation management
	statements to <a href="#section-ssp">SSP</a>, and delegates
	statements related to temporal accuracy to <a

    </p><h2><a name="section-geometry">Geometry Library</a></h2>

      The <em>Geometry Library</em> is a general purpose geometry
      library, with some essential geometrical operators, not commonly
      found in other geometrical libraries.  It gives a low-level data
      representation of 3D and 2D lines, and defines operations on
      them like volume, surface and intersection calculations.  This
      library is meant to be a gateway for more complex operations too
      (like dendritic surface reconstruction from a stack of EM
      images).

      The Reconstruct Interface reads XML files written by the <a

      software</a>, and writes it out to Neurospaces declarative NDF
      format.  This involves geometrical operations, so this interface
      relies on the Geometry Library.  The interface allows to
      separate out contours with different tags.

    </p><h2><a name="section-simulation-browser">Neurospaces Project Browser</a></h2>

      The <em>Neurospaces project browser</em> is a set of modules for
      the <a href="http://www.webmin.com/usermin.html">Usermin web
      server</a>.  This allows you to browse projects, inspect, and
      compare simulation results or other data over a web interface.

	The specific aims of the project browser are introduced in <a
	href="CNS2007-workshop/index.html">the presentation given at
	the model sharing workshop at the CNS*2007 meeting in
	Toronto</a>.

      <p>

	The project browser uses distributed version control
	mechanisms to physically distribute your project.  The
	coupling to a web server allows to inspect your simulations
	and compare results, regardless of location.

      The <em>Configurator Package</em> contains configuration

      and simulator servers in a convenient way.

      The configurator package is used by developers to automate the
      synchronization of software code repositories, and is required
      to implement distributed model mining services.


    </p><h2><a name="section-developer">Additional background information</a></h2>

      <ul>

	<li>

	  The Neurospaces project develops software components that
	  match with the <a href="./cbi.png">CBI simulator
	  architecture</a>, which is also used in GENESIS 3 as a
	  common framework.  Despite the apparant size of this
	  project, already many components have been developed and
	  integrated into a working simulator (more information to
	  follow, yet see also the poster presentation at the Society
	  for Neuroscience Meeting, November 2007)

	<li>

	  The Neurospaces project encompasses an increasing number of
	  projects.  So correct and consistent deployment becomes more
	  important.  The <a
	  href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/">autotools</a>
	  do a lot of things automatically.  I try to develop tools
	  that are compliant with the <a
	  href="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/">Filesystem Hierarchy
	  Standard</a>.

	<li>

	  The Neurospaces model container uses XML indexing and node
	  identification techniques.  I should give a pointer here to
	  relevant background information.

	<li>

	  At the data modeling level, none of the lower-level tools
	  presented here make a difference between data and meta-data,
	  because it is in the end the application that must make this
	  difference.  As a result, all data formats developed for the
	  Neurospaces project allow easy information extraction from
	  the application data as well as the application 'meta-data'.
	  If such statements are more like English Chinese to you, and
	  you think it is important to understand these subtle
	  differences, see e.g. <a
	  href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata">this entry in
	  wikipedia</a>.  In neuroscience modeling, these differences
	  are extremely important, simply because any model has
	  numerous builtin assumptions about its immediate
	  environment.  So there is no explicit separation possible
	  between the different dimensions of the data.
