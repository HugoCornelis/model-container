    <h1>Technologies</h1>

    <p>

      Some software engineers have expressed interest in what
      methodology I use to do Neurospaces development.  Right now, I
      only reuse many common patterns, present in various frameworks
      (e.g. <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_framework">Spring</a>
      and <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">aspect
      oriented programming</a>).  For the rest I don't use a fancy
      framework, because computational neuroscience simulator
      technology is not yet ready for it.  The Neurospaces project is
      a search for such a framework.

    <p>

      Comparing for a moment to the aforementioned Spring framework,
      the following tools are present, in one form or another, in the
      current incarnation of the Neurospaces project:

    <ul>

      <li> Inversion of Control container: the <em><a
	    href="#section-ssp">Simple Scheduler in Perl</a></em> does a
	couple of things for dependency injection, much work remains
	to be done, if it is ever needed.

      <li> For low-level code, I have written a C code generator that
      allows for inheritance and highly-granular method
      instrumentation, a first step towards AOP.  Aspect-oriented
      programming framework: aspect oriented programming is supported
      natively by scripting languages as perl.

      <li> Data access framework: the <a
	  href="#section-simulation-browser">project browser</a> relies
	on Sesa, and can, in principle, be bound to external data
	access frameworks.  Again, if this is ever going to be
	necessary remains to be seen (for web-collaboration sessions
	?).

      <li> Transaction management framework: not present (for
	simulations, this not needed in the short term either).

      <li> Model-view-controller framework: the split of the simulator
      in <a href="#section-neurospaces">middle-ware</a> for the data
      container, the <a href="#section-heccer">solver</a>s, and the <a
      href="#section-ssp">scheduler</a>, is partially based on the
      model-view-controller paradigm.

      <li> Remote Access framework: not present, although needed, in
	principle, that is.

      <li> Authentication and authorization framework: the Sesa
	framework provides this, in a 'primitive and premature'
	fashion.

      <li> Remote Management framework: not present, unsure if that
	is needed.

      <li> Messaging framework: not present, way to early to even
	think about it.

      <li> Testing framework: the tools in the neurospaces project
	use a sophisticated tester, that implements a clear-cut
	separation between test specification (application behaviour)
	and test implementation.  Changing the implementation allows
	to convert the test specifications to HTML, or to extract certain
	data from the specification (e.g. show me a test that uses
	command 'X').

    </ul>

    <p>

      For component integration, I use:

    <ul>
      <li>
	<a href="http://www.swig.org">Swig</a> to expose low level
	functionality of components, fi. Heccer or Neurospaces, to
	higher level programming languages and scripting languages.

      <li>
	the <a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a> programming
	language, because (1) I am very familiar with the internals of
	Perl, and (2) there is a very broad library of Perl modules
	available from <a href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</a>.  Some
	people tell me that I should be using Python, for easy
	interfacing with <a
	href="http://www.neuralensemble.org/">PyNN</a> (and they are
	right about it, but I don't know much Python).

    </ul>

    <p>
